# ReactNativeWithSwiftUITutorial
Supportive material for the tutorial about React Native and SwiftUI

I'm actively working on the article, but if all you need is a couple of code pointers, you're very welcome to explore this repository on your own. The best way to exlore this repository is (in my opinion) by going through releases. I tried to compose some reasonable release notes to ease the learning curve. If you spot any mistakes, inconsistencies or just wish to make the code better, consider opening an issue or submitting a PR.
